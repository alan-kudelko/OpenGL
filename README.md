This project represents my first experience working with OpenGL. It includes my initial implementation of essential classes and utilities designed to support future projects involving graphics and real-time rendering. The code serves as a foundational framework for experiments and learning, and will be gradually expanded as I gain more experience with OpenGL and related technologies.
