This repository represents my first experience working with OpenGL. It includes my initial implementation of essential classes and utilities designed to support future projects involving OpenGL and real-time rendering. I am currently working on the implementation of basic classes that will serve as the foundation for building a larger OpenGL project, such as an Arkanoid-style game. My custom classes are located in the GLS folder and include:

1. GL_SHAPES: a class designed to simplify and automate the construction of geometric primitives,
2. GL_VERTEX: a class that stores vertex data used by GL_SHAPES,
3. GL_SHADER: a class responsible for loading, compiling, linking, and debugging shaders.
